Hi, I’m Sloan Thrasher

I've worked in many programming languages and many platforms. Currently I use PHP, Javascript, CSS3, HTML5, MySQL and Windows Powershell.

I have also started writing some WordPress plugins.

I also enjoy woodworking, photography and painting.

Since retirement, I prefer small projects, or projects that challenge my curiosity.
